# Lesson Use Cases

A hypothetical workflow for a simple reading quiz: 

- I create a new lesson for tomorrow,
- I indicate that we will start the lesson with a reading comprehension check
- I indicate that the text is *To Kill a Mockingbird* (functionally a search), 
- I indicate that the assessment boundaries are chapters 1-4, 
- I indicate that the assessment goal is comprehension, and then finally 
- I select ten questions (or as many as I like) from a list pre-populated with questions previously used for this purpose. 
- The quiz is created, saved, and populates my lesson. 

## User Value
This should be significantly faster than either searching for a quiz with those constraints and remaking it to be usage or writing a quiz from scratch. 

That said, if itâ€™s already made then I can just pull it down and use it again. This is, of course, one of the traps teachers fall into because their curriculum doesn't get renewed or improved - the effort it its creation is too high to discard/remake it often.
